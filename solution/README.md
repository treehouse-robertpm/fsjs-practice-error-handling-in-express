# Error Handling in Express

When user’s make a request to a server, it’s important for that server to handle requests for resources that don’t exist, as well as other potential server errors.  Handling errors well can help your users understand what’s going on with your app when something goes wrong.  There are a number of ways to handle errors on a server, which can make the process somewhat confusing.  So getting some extra practice working on the process of identifying and dealing with a variety of server errors will benefit your education and the development of your server side skills.

In this practice session, you’re provided with a very basic Express app.  To start working on this exercise, download the project files, unzip them, open them up in your preferred text editor, and in the terminal, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.  Then run `npm start` to launch the app.  And then point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser.

Then follow along with the instructions in the practice session videos, and if you get stuck or are unable to solve the exercise on your own, no worries.  We'll show you one solution in final video of the practice session.
